# Insurgency- Dedicated Community Server config. files
 All the files with default settings and values that I use to create an Insurgency Dedicated server.

### Dependencies
- [Sourcemod](https://www.sourcemod.net/), [Installing Sourcemod](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_SourceMod).
- Steam Workshop Mods:
    - [theater](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1953775882) - v1.92(or latest)
    - [assets](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1947384)
    - [misc assets](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2090146266)
 - Optional Dependencies:

### Setup
1. [Setup Dedicated server](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345661185) with steamcmd. The files used in this tutorial such as server.cfg and the start batch script (to run the server) can be found inside [insurgency folder](https://github.com/Carbonautics/Insurgency-server/tree/master/insurgency).
2. Download this repo. as a zip file. Extract copy and paste in your server's root(main) folder.
**_NOTE:** I suggest you take things slow and replace one file at a time only after understand what each file does and how your server reacts to changes in that file. This will save troubleshooting time in-case some files are not compatible with each other following some updates._
3. Change the configs to your requirements and liking and enjoy. 
4. You can deactive plugins by moving the corresponding files to '/disabled/' folder inside the [plugins folder](https://github.com/Carbonautics/Insurgency-server/tree/master/insurgency/addons/sourcemod/plugins) to not use some features that you do not like.
5. If you can mod, you can edit the plugins inside scripting to tweak some plugins to make your server feel unique. _(Do not change author details, although the plugins were open-source, respect their hard-work and credit them for it. I have not 'created' any plugins, I have edited them as per our requirements.)_

### Features:
- Custom Server with upto 30 bots (with max. players) and LobbySize is at 16 (depends on theater)
